## 1.6.0
- Added GUI (beta!) using /besttools gui
- Added new blacklist command, so that BestTools will not change tools when trying to break those blocks.

Usage:

- /besttools bl add -- Adds your currently held item to your blacklist
- /besttools bl add inventory -- Adds all items from your inventory to your blacklist
- /besttools bl add hotbar -- Adds all items from your hotbar to your blacklist
- /besttools bl add <items...> -- Add specified items to your blacklist
- /besttools bl remove -- Removes your currently held item from your blacklist
- /besttools bl remove inventory -- Removes all items from your inventory from your blacklist
- /besttools bl remove hotbar -- Removes all items from your hotbar from your blacklist
- /besttools bl remove <items...> -- Remove items from your blacklist
- /besttools bl reset -- Removes all items from your blacklist

## 1.5.0
- Instant breakable blocks like torches, grass, flowers etc. are no broken with the current item if it's not a hoe (because the hoe would take damage)
- Does not empty a slot into the inventory to use the empty hand to break a block when another undamagable item or block from the hotbar can be used instead
- Further performance optimization
  - replaced LinkedLists with ArrayLists
  - pregenerates tools material list instead of comparing strings (which was done to avoid problems with versions before netherite tools)1
  - checks player cache before checking everything else like permissions to further speed things up
- Added performance test mode (/besttools performance, needs permission besttools.debug)


## 1.4.1
- Added measure-performance option to demonstrate how fast BestTools is

## 1.4.0
##### Huuuuuge performance boost by caching two simple values

BestTools will now cache the last material a player has interacted with, and a boolean whether something important in their inventory has changed.

If the player interacts with the same material again, and they neither picked up a tool, broke a tool, changed their currently held item, nor dropped a tool, the BestTools listener will immediately exit because the player still has the best tool in his hands. This should improve performance by a greeeeeaaaaaaat amount. Even hundreds of players stripmining at once with golden efficiency 5 pickaxes should not be a problem for BestTools! :)

Also cleaned up the code.

## 1.3.0
- Added config option "dont-switch-during-battle" (default: true) that prevents BestTools from switching to a tool if the player currently holds a weapon (Sword, Crossbow, Bow or Trident)

- Added German translation

- Added Spanish translation
- Added download link to Update checker
